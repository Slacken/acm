Groundhogs acivity at a rectangular area ,and X, Y is the two side of this rectangle, The number N stands for the number of holes.Then exactly N lines follow, each containing two integer numbers xi and yi (0 &lt;= xi &lt;= X, 0 &lt;= yi &lt;= Y) indicating the coordinates of one home.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>Print exactly two lines for each test case.The first line is the coordinate of xiaomi's home which we help to find. The second line is he longest distance between xiaomi's home and the other groundhog's home.The output round to the nearest number with exactly one digit after the decimal point (0.05 rounds up to 0.1). </div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Input</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">1000 50 1
