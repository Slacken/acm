Some of the pencils cost four cents each, some are two for a penny and the rest are four for a penny. How many pencils of each type does the man get?</ul>One clarification from the program of 6 July: correct solutions contain at least <i>one</i> of each pencil type.<br><br><center><img src=../../../data/images/C239-1005-1.jpg></center><br>For our purposes, we will expand on the problem, rather than just getting 20 pencils for 20 cents (which is shown in the sample output below).
