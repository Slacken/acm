The list below shows which<br>letters they used and what numeric value each of those letters represents:<br><br>I = 1<br>V = 5<br>X = 10<br>L = 50<br>C = 100<br>D = 500<br>M = 1000<br><br>Using these seven numerals, any desired number can be formed by following the two basic additive and subtractive rules. To form a number using<br>the additive rule the Roman numerals are simply written from left to right in descending order, and the value of each roman numeral is added<br>together. For example, the number MMCLVII has the value 1000 + 1000 + 100 + 50 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 2157. Using the addition rule alone could lead to<br>very long strings of letters, so the subtraction rule was invented as a result. Using this rule, a smaller Roman numeral to the left of a larger one is<br>subtracted from the total. In other words, the number MCMXIV is interpreted as 1000 - 100 + 1000 + 10 - 1 + 5 = 1914.<br><br>Over time the Roman number writing system became more standardized and several additional rules were developed. The additional rules used today<br>are:<br><br>1. The I, X, or C Roman numerals may only be repeated up to three times in succession. In other words, the number 4 must be represented as IV<br>and not as IIII.<br>2. The V, L, or D numerals may never be repeated in succession, and the M numeral may be repeated as many 2. times as necessary.<br>3. Only one smaller numeral can be placed to the left of another. For example, the number 18 is represented as XVIII but not as XIIX.<br>4. Only the I, X, or C can be used as subtractive numerals.<br>5. A subtractive I can only be used to the left of a V or X. Likewise a X can only appear to the left of a L or C, and a C can only be used to the<br>left of a D or M. For example, 49 must be written as XLIX and not as IL.<br><br>Your goal is to write a program which converts Roman numbers to base 10 integers.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>The input to this problem will consist of the following:<br><br>A line with a single integer &quot;N&quot; (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000), where N indicates how many Roman numbers are to be converted.<br>A series of N lines of input with each line containing one Roman number.
