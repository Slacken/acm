The game is similar to a famous anime ¡°Fate Stay Night¡±. In the game, you should control your ¡°servant¡± Saber to fight another ¡°servant¡± Berserker. <br><br>Berserker is a famous hero who has a lot of lives. In every life, he has some ¡°blood points¡±. For example, he may have 100 blood points in his first life and 200 blood points in his second life. When Berserker loss all blood points in a life, he is killed. But he will become alive immediately with next life. When there is no next life left, Berserker is really dead and you win.<br>Saber can attack Berserker for N times. During each attack, Saber releases a fire bird to fight Berserker. Each fire bird has some ¡°power points¡±.<br>A fire bird can make Berserker loss blood points. But if Berserker loss one blood point, the fire bird also will loss one power point. When the power points of a fire bird become zero, the fire bird dies.<br>A living fire bird may be in two statuses:¡°young¡±or ¡°old¡±.<br>When a fire bird is just released, it is ¡°young¡±. After it kills Berserker once or more, it becomes¡°old¡±.<br>Let¡¯s suppose a fire bird with remaining n power points fighting Berserker with remaining m blood points in his current life:<br>If n&gt; m: Berserker will be killed and becomes alive immediately with his next life(if he has), and then the fire bird will be¡°old¡±and fight Berserker again with remaining n-m power points.<br><br>If n = m: Berserker will be killed and becomes alive with his next life (if he has), and the fire bird dies.<br><br>If n &lt; m: In this situation, if the fire bird is ¡°young¡±, it will die after making Berserker loss n blood points. But if the fire bird is ¡°old¡±, it just dies without doing any harm to Berserker.<br><br>As the ¡°Master¡± of Saber, you can use ¡°Command Mantra¡± M times. You can use ¡°Command Mantra¡±to double a fire bird¡¯s power points, but you can¡¯t use ¡°Command Mantra¡±more than once on a same fire bird. Now there is the question: How many times can you kill Berserker at most? <br><br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>There are several data cases, ended with ¡°0 0 0¡±<br>For each test case:<br>The first line contains three integers N,M,K, meaning the number of attacks of Saber, the times of Command Mantra you can use and the number of lives of Berserker.<br>The second line contains N integers, indicating the power points of N fire birds, in the order of attacking. You can¡¯t change the attacking order.<br><br>The third line contains K integers, meaning the blood points of all Berserker¡¯s lives. The first integer is for his first life, the second integer is for his second life, etc. <br>Please note: 1&lt;=N&lt;=10000, 0&lt;=M&lt;=100, 0&lt;=K&lt;=100000. All power points and blood points are no more than 10000 and none negative. <br><br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>For each test case, output one line containing the maximum times that you can kill Berserker. <br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Input</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">10 0 20
