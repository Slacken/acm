He never wants to damage his health by staying up late at night or leaving his stomach empty without having meals. He always goes to bed at 10 pm,and gets up at 7 am next morning. He often goes to the dinning hall at the meal time,even if he is engaged with a lot of work at hand during the dinner time. In a word, healthy regular life holds higher priority than anything else in Samuel's opinion. <br>      According to the traditional Chinese medical care spirit,breakfast ought to be finished at about 7 am, lunch time at about 12 o'clock, and supper time at about 5 pm. Sleep cannot be later than 1 o'clock am because 1-2 am is a precious time for the liver to relax and rebuild itself. If you have a habit of sleeping later than 2 o'clock, you have to pay more attention to your liver before it is too late. And it has been proved that only by sleeping early and for enough time will your liver function well. <br>Here are some principles of living a health life:<br><img src=../../../data/images/C173-1006-1.jpg><br>      Samuel holds the view that health is the firm foundation of your work,so he sticks to these principles in order to lead a health life.

According to the principle he at least needs to sleep
for 7 hours. So he does not lead a healthy life.
In the second case,he does very well on all the aspects so he is leading a healthy life.  </div><i style='font-size:1px'> </i></div></pre></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Author</div> <div class=panel_content>Samuel</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Source</div> <div class=panel_content> <a href='/search.php?field=problem&key=灰色橙子 专场&source=1&searchmode=source'> 灰色橙子 专场 </a> </div> <div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Recommend</div> <div class=panel_content>zty</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><center style='font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#1A5CC8'><a href='statistic.php?pid=2631'>Statistic</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href='submit.php?pid=2631'>Submit</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="./discuss/problem/list.php?problemid=2631">Discuss</a> | <a href='note/note.php?pid=2631'>Note</a><br></td></tr></div></body></html>
