But there always exists a big problem: every kid in this game want to play the role of Hawk.  <br>So the teacher came up with an idea: Vote. Every child have some nice handkerchiefs, and if he/she think someone is suitable for the role of Hawk, he/she gives a handkerchief to this kid, which means this kid who is given the handkerchief win the support. Note the support can be transmitted. Kids who get the most supports win in the vote and able to play the role of Hawk.(A note:if A can win<br>support from B(A != B) A can win only one support from B in any case the number of the supports transmitted from B to A are many. And A can't win the support from himself in any case.<br>If two or more kids own the same number of support from others, we treat all of them as winner.<br>Here's a sample: 3 kids A, B and C, A gives a handkerchief to B, B gives a handkerchief to C, so C wins 2 supports and he is choosen to be the Hawk.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>There are several test cases. First is a integer T(T &lt;= 50), means the number of test cases.<br>Each test case start with two integer n, m in a line (2 &lt;= n &lt;= 5000, 0 &lt;m &lt;= 30000). n means there are n children(numbered from 0 to n - 1). Each of the following m lines contains two integers A and B(A != B) denoting that the child numbered A give a handkerchief to B.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>For each test case, the output should first contain one line with &quot;Case x:&quot;, here x means the case number start from 1. Followed by one number which is the total <font color=red>supports</font> the winner(s) get. <br>Then follow a line contain all the Hawks' number. The numbers must be listed in increasing order and separated by single spaces. </div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Input</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">2
