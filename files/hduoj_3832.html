Each street light can be viewed as a point in a plane, which casts flash in a circular area with certain radius.<br>What's more, if two illuminated circles share one intersection or a point, they can be regarded as connected.<br>Now the manager wants to turn off as many lights as possible, guaranteeing that the illuminated area of the library, the study room and the dormitory are still connected(directly or indirectly). So, at least the lights in these three places will not be turned off.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>The first line contains a single integer T, which tells you there are T cases followed.<br>In each case:<br>The first line is an integer N( 3&lt;=N&lt;=200 ), means there are N street lights at total.<br>Then there are N lines: each line contain 3 integers, X,Y,R,( 1&lt;=X,Y,R&lt;=1000 ), means the light in position(X,Y) can illuminate a circle area with the radius of R. Note that the 1st of the N lines is corresponding to the library, the 2nd line is corresponding to the study room, and the 3rd line is corresponding to the dorm.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>One case per line, output the maximal number of lights that can be turned off.<br>Note that if none of the lights is turned off and the three places are still not connected. Just output -1.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Input</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">3
