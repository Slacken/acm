There are n students in the class. The students didn¡¯t want to tell their teacher their exact score; they only told their teacher their rank in the province (in the form of intervals).<br><br>After asking all the students, the teacher found that some students didn¡¯t tell the truth. For example, Student1 said he was between 5004th and 5005th, Student2 said he was between 5005th and 5006th, Student3 said he was between 5004th and 5006th, Student4 said he was between 5004th and 5006th, too. This situation is obviously impossible. So at least one told a lie. Because the teacher thinks most of his students are honest, he wants to know how many students told the truth at most.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>There is an integer in the first line, represents the number of cases (at most 100 cases). In the first line of every case, an integer n (n &lt;= 60) represents the number of students. In the next n lines of every case, there are 2 numbers in each line, X<sub>i</sub> and Y<sub>i</sub> (1 &lt;= X<sub>i</sub> &lt;= Y<sub>i</sub> &lt;= 100000), means the i-th student¡¯s rank is between X<sub>i</sub> and Y<sub>i</sub>, inclusive.<br><br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>Output 2 lines for every case. Output a single number in the first line, which means the number of students who told the truth at most. In the second line, output the students who tell the truth, separated by a space. Please note that there are no spaces at the head or tail of each line. If there are more than one way, output the list with maximum lexicographic. (In the example above, 1 2 3;1 2 4;1 3 4;2 3 4 are all OK, and 2 3 4 with maximum lexicographic)</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Input</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">2
