The Sacred Warrior¡¯s abilities revolve around shortening his own lifespan to spear his foes to burinng pieces.When we control the Sacred Warrior , we always want to give our enemies the most damage.So to simplify the problem,let¡¯s consider the Sacred Warrior¡¯s two skills as below:<br><br>(1) Burning Spear<br><br>When the Sacred Warrior use the Burning Spear to attack his enemy, follow things will happen in order in the current second:<br><br>1.the enemy gets physical hurt by a normal attatk.<br><br>2.if the enemy¡¯s burning degree BD is greater than zero,the enemy will gets BD*FI damage points.(at the beginning,the enemy¡¯s burning degree is zero).<br><br>3.the enemy¡¯s burning degree +1.<br><br>4.the remanent burning time become 6.<br><br>5.the Sacred Warrior¡¯s HP decrease by D. The Sacred Warrior can not kill himself(don¡¯t ask me why),that is,when the Sacred Warrior¡¯s HP is less than or equal to D, the Sacred Warrior can not use Burning Spear!<br><br>When the Sacred Warrior use a single normal attack instead of Burning Spear, follow things will happen in order in the current second:<br><br>1.the enemy gets physical hurt by the normal attack.<br><br>2.if the enemy¡¯s burning degree BD is greater than zero,the enemy will gets BD*FI damage points.(at the beginning,the enemy¡¯s burning degree is zero).<br><br>3.the remanent burning time decrease by 1.<br><br>4.if the remanent burning time is zero, then the enemy¡¯s burning degree become zero.<br><br>(2) Berserk¡¯s blood<br><br>The Sacred Warrior¡¯s base attack is A.<br><br>Whenever the Sacred Warrior¡¯HP reduce R ,his attack will increase U, it means the Sacred Warrior will get ((HS-HC) / R)*U extra attack.(round down for division, hs is the original HP and the hc is the current HP).<br><br>The normal attack NA is the sum of base attack and extra attack.<br><br>The enemy has a defence degree DEFi and it change every second(the reason is complicated,such as Weave,Meld,Gush,Natural Order,Mekansm and so on).Whenever the enemy is attacked by a normal attack(a single normal attack or the first part of Burning Spear), if the enemy¡¯s defence degree is greater than the normal attack, the enemy won¡¯t get any physical hurt(but the burning effect is still effective), otherwise the enemy will get NA-DEFi damage.(NA is the current normal attack and the DEFi is the current defence degree).<br><br>Every second The Sacred Warrior can choose using a single normal attack or Burning Spear to attack the enemy. But in order to make the most damage and lose too much HP is obviously not wise. So we use a evaluation function F=C - (HS-HE)*P to evaluate the fight. (hs is the original HP and the he is the HP after last second, C is the total damage he cause).Can you find the maximal F ?</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>The first line contains a single positive integer N( N &lt;= 20 ), indicates the number of test cases.<br><br>For each test case:<br><br>The first line contains eight integers T , HS , A , R , U , D , FI , P , T is the total time in seconds and the others is as described above.<br><br>The second line contains T integers , the i-th integer is the defence degree DEFi in i-th second.<br><br>0&lt; T &lt; 200 , 0&lt; HS &lt; 100 , 0 &lt; A &lt; 5000 , 0&lt; R &lt; HS , 3&lt;= D &lt;= 10 , 0 &lt;= U , FI , P &lt;1000<br><br>0 &lt;= DEFi &lt;3000</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>For each test case, print a line containing the test case number (beginning with 1) and the maximal F.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Input</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">2

In the first case:

The Sacred Warrior use burning spear in second 1,2 and 3, use single normal attack in second 4 and 5.

TIME 0 1 2 3 4 5HP 10 7 4 1 1 1defence 0 0 0 0 0 0

normal atk 0 5 7 9 11 11burning atk 0 0 2 4 6 6

So F=(5+7+9+11+11+0+2+4+6+6)-(10-1)*1=52;

In the second case:

The Sacred Warrior use burning spear in second 1,2 and 3, use single normal attack in second 4 and 5.

TIME 0 1 2 3 4 5HP 10 7 4 1 1 1defence 0 2 2 2 2 2

normal atk 0 1 1 1 2 2burning atk 0 0 5 10 15 15

Because every second the DEFi is greater than or equal to the normal attack, so the normal attack is complete invalid.

So F=(0+5+10+15+15)-(10-1)*1=36;
