A pupil stops after the question is answered correctly. Each pupil is allowed up to five attempts to answer the question correctly. Pupils who answer correctly on the first attempt are marked present. Pupils who answer correctly after more than one attempt are encouraged to work at home. Pupils who fail to develop a correct answer within five attempts are given remedial classes after school. Pupils who do not give any answer are marked as abscent.
