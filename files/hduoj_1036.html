Each member of a team runs one section of the race. Your task is to help to evaluate the results of a relay race. <br><br>You have to process several teams. For each team you are given a list with the running times for every section of the race. You are to compute the average time per kilometer over the whole distance. That's easy, isn't it? <br>So if you like the fun and challenge competing at this contest, perhaps you like a relay race, too. Students from Ulm participated e.g. at the &quot;SOLA&quot; relay in Zurich, Switzerland. For more information visit http://www.sola.asvz.ethz.ch/ after the contest is over.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>The first line of the input specifies the number of sections n followed by the total distance of the relay d in kilometers. You may safely assume that 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 20 and 0.0 &lt; d &lt; 200.0. Every following line gives information about one team: the team number t (an integer, right-justified in a field of width 3) is followed by the n results for each section, separated by a single space. These running times are given in the format &quot;h:mm:ss&quot; with integer numbers for the hours, minutes and seconds, respectively. In the special case of a runner being disqualified, the running time will be denoted by &quot;-:--:--&quot;. Finally, the data on every line is terminated by a newline character. Input is terminated by EOF.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>For each team output exactly one line giving the team's number t right aligned in a field of width 3, and the average time for this team rounded to whole seconds in the format &quot;m:ss&quot;. If at least one of the team's runners has been disqualified, output &quot;-&quot; instead. Adhere to the sample output for the exact format of presentation.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Input</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">2 12.5
