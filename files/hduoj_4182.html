Every inmate is assigned a set P of N people to help with their finances and a limit of K minutes. In addition to the circumstances of the jth person, 1 &lt;= j &lt;= N, a time penalty of ej for choosing not to give advice and the time duration of dj minutes allotted to provide the advice are also made clear to the inmate. An inmate starts his community service at time T equal to zero. If the inmate started working with the jth person at time T, then he must terminate his work no later than T+dj. Regardless of the validity of the advice and time of completion, a value of C<sub>j</sub> ( = T+ d<sub>j</sub> ) is deducted from the inmate's alloted minutes. Also the inmate is not permitted to work with another person until the time T+ d<sub>j</sub>. If S is the set of people helped by an inmate, then the total number of used minutes is calculated as <img src=../../../data/images/C388-1005-2.JPG> <br>Your task is to write a program to calculate the maximum number of persons that can be helped by an inmate without exceeding his K minutes limit.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>Input consists of sets for many inmates.

Each of the following N lines contains two integers, separated by a single space, which represent the penalty and time duration one person to be assisted.
