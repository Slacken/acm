It is said that having these proofs proves that the sailor is the champion of all sailors. Four sailors unwittingly involved in the struggle of the quest of the search of the Proof of the Conqueror. <br><br>- from wikipedia<br></i><br>Li Huamei, an Admiral of Ming Dynasty, is one of the four protagonists in the story. She trys to find the &quot;Proof of the Conqueror&quot; for the revitalization of the motherland. One person's power is limited, so she searches for like-minded people to help her. <br><br>When Li's fleet voyages to the New World, she meets an intelligent man - Fernandes and invite him to become a member of the fleet as a staff officer. While Fernandes is a strange man, he requires that he will join only if Li can win in the following game: <br><br>At the beginning, there are N piles of coins on the desk, the i-th pile has P<sub>i</sub> coins. Then Fernandes and Li take turns to take coins from those piles on the desk according to the following rule: when it is someone's turn to take coins, at first, he/she has to select no more than K (and no less than 1) piles that still have coins arbitrarily, then take arbitrary number (at least 1) of coins from each piles he/she selects. The game is over until all coins are taken, and the winer is the person who takes the last coin. <br><br>Fernandes is very familiar with this game, and Li is also very clever. So you can assume that both of them know the best strategy to win the game. Now we know the situation at the beginning, and that Fernandes takes coins first. The question is who will win the game? <br><br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>The first line of the input is a single integer T, representing the number of test cases.
