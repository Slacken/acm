He likes walking around the streets very much. He walks around the street until the sky is black every day. When he go back home , his mother always very angry with him. ¡°what are you doing , it¡¯ s  so late now¡± his mother always asked him loudly. ShaDan always answer ¡°I¡¯m watching the scenery around the street¡±.<br>One day, when ShaDan was walking around the street, he thought how can I visit all the streets and cost minimum time. So that, he can go back home earlier and his mother will not blame him. The streets ShaDan visited is very strange. They are all one-way streets. All the cars on a street is drived along in one direction. But ShaDan can walk around the street in two directions. For example , if the street is from city i to city j , cars can only be drived on the street from the city I to city j.  But ShaDan can walk around the street from the city i to city j and also can walk around  the street form the city j to city i .  In addition , ShaDan  have a Super-capacity.   Every  move  , he can  choose  a city i  ,  and  it  doesn¡¯t  cost  time. When he is in a city I,he have two ways to visit the streets. <br>The first one :he is in the city  i , and  he can walk around all the streets that from the city i ( for example  i= 2  , he can walk 2-&gt;5, 2-&gt;3 , 2 - &gt;6 ,if there exists a street ),  it will costs he Wi  to  visit  all the streets from city i.<br>The second one : he is in the city i, and he can walk around all the streets  to city I  ( for example  i= 2  , he can walk 5-&gt;2, 4-&gt;2 , 3 - &gt;2 ,if there exists a street ), it will costs he Pi  to  visit  all the streets to city i.<br>Although ShaDan have a Super-capiacity , but his IQ is very low. <br>He is unable to deal with the problem . So he asked his best friends RPRUSH to help him to calculate the minimum time to visit all the streets.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>Input contains multiple test cases.
