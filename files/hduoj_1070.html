There are many kinds of milk in the supermarket, so Ignatius wants to know which kind of milk is the cheapest.<br><br>Here are some rules:<br>1. Ignatius will never drink the milk which is produced 6 days ago or earlier. That means if the milk is produced 2005-1-1, Ignatius will never drink this bottle after 2005-1-6(inclusive).<br>2. Ignatius drinks 200mL milk everyday.<br>3. If the milk left in the bottle is less than 200mL, Ignatius will throw it away.<br>4. All the milk in the supermarket is just produced today.<br><br>Note that Ignatius only wants to buy one bottle of milk, so if the volumn of a bottle is smaller than 200mL, you should ignore it.<br>Given some information of milk, your task is to tell Ignatius which milk is the cheapest.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>The input contains several test cases.
