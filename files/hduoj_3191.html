For a long period, he went to office with the shortest path because he loves to sleep late¡­Time goes by, he find that he should have some changes as you could see, always riding with the same path is boring.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, oooccc1 got an idea! Why could I take another path? Tired at all the tasks he got, he got no time to carry it out. As a best friend of his, you¡¯re going to help him!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Since oooccc1 is now getting up earlier, he is glad to take those paths, which are a little longer than the shortest one. To be precisely, you are going to find all the second shortest paths.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;You would be given a directed graph G, together with the start point S which stands for oooccc¡¯1 his house and target point E presents his office. And there is no cycle in the graph. Your task is to tell him how long are these paths and how many there are.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>There are some cases. Proceed till the end of file.<br>The first line of each case is three integers N, M, S, E (3 &lt;= N &lt;= 50, 0 &lt;= S , E &lt;N)<br>N stands for the nodes in that graph, M stands for the number of edges, S stands for the start point, and E stands for the end point.<br>Then M lines follows to describe the edges: x y w. x stands for the start point, and y stands for another point, w stands for the length between x and y. <br>All the nodes are marked from 0 to N-1. </div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>For each case,please output the length and count for those second shortest paths in one line.
