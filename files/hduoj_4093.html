One of his favourites is the following:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Xerier, his classmate, has made many cards. She writes down a single positive number on each of them. No numbers written on different cards are the same. After that she writes down an equation, whose right side is a single positive number chosen by her, and the left side is the sum of p integers:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she asks Xavier put p cards on the corresponding Xi¡¯s position to make this equation correct, with an additional condition that Xi should be ordered from smaller to bigger, i.e.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time Xavier immediately comes up with many solutions. Now he wants to know how many solutions in total are there for any n given by Xerier.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are multiple test cases. The number of them is given in the beginning of the input. Then a series of input block comes one by one.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;For each test case:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The first line contains two space-separated integers m and p (1&lt;=p&lt;=5).  The second line contains m distinct positive integers - the numbers written on each of the cards. None of these integers exceeds 13000.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are about 120 test cases in total, but 90% of them are relatively small. More precisely, all numbers are less than or equal to 100 in 90% of the test cases.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>&nbsp;&nbsp;For each test case:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;For each positive integer, output the number of ways in a single line. To keep the output finite, only numbers with positive ways should be outputted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Output a blank line after each test case. See sample for more format details.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Input</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">3
