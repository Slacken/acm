With the citizen from earth starts first, two players make their operations by turns. Every operation they make must meet the conditions:<br>Choose a bulb which is now on, then turn it off, and we assume this bulb is numbered p;<br>Choose a bulb and change its state(if on, then turn off, else, turn on), and suppose it is numbered q, which should meet the request of q &lt;= p/2.<br><br>In addition, the step 2 is not a must.<br>And the one cannot move loses.<br>Eventually, the smart earth citizen wins this test soon.<br><br>However, another question is asked by an evil alien: Supposing there are turned-on bulbs in some sections at the beginning, and the other states can be decided by the citizen from earth.
