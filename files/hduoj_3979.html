In order to defend the homeland, V11 picks up his weapon and fights!<br><br>All the monsters attack v11 at the same time. Every enemy has its HP, and attack value ATK. In this problem, v11 has his ATK and infinite HP. The damage (also means reduction for HP) is exactly the ATK the attacker has. For example, if v11's ATK is 13 and the monster's HP is 27, then after v11's attack, the monster's HP become 27 - 13 = 14 and vice versa.<br><br>v11 and the monsters attack each other at the same time and they could only attack one time per second. When the monster's HP is less or equal to 0 , we think this monster was killed, and obviously it would not attack any more. For example, v11's ATK is 10 and a monster's HP is 5, v11 attacks and then the monster is killed! However, a monster whose HP is 15 will be killed after v11 attack for two times. v11 will never stop until all the monsters are killed ! He wants to minimum the HP reduction for the fight! Please note that if in some second, some monster will soon be killed , the monster's attack will works too.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>The first line is one integer T indicates the number of the test cases.
