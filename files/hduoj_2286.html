Gods always tell the truth whereas devils sometimes tell the truth but sometimes not. What's more, every god and devil knows all the others are a god or a devil. <br>One day, an accident unfortunately happened which made echo lose her memory. She was so despairing and determined to turn to others for help. She asked all the residents a question, but all of the answers were merely &quot;Be careful! X is a devil!&quot;. As a result she failed to arouse her memory. However, she has to find out a method to calculate the minimum number of devils on the island. Could you help echo to manage it well?</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>There are multi-cases (The total number of cases won't exceed 20). First line is an integer N(1&lt;=N&lt;=15000), the total number of gods and devils. Then N lines follow, each line includes a name, and the length of each name won't exceed 30. The first name is &quot;echo&quot;. The next N-1 lines will be as the formation &quot;A says: Be careful! B is a devil!&quot;(A is different from B), and you can assume that at least one of them will consider echo is a devil and says &quot;Be careful! echo is a devil!&quot;.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>Output the minimum number of devils in the island.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Input</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">3
