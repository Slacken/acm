In order to stop it, let¡¯s bomb the opponent¡¯s base.<br>It seems not to be a hard work in circumstances of street battles, however, you¡¯ll be encountered a much more difficult instance: recounting exploits of the military. In the bombing action, the commander will dispatch a group of bombers with weapons having the huge destructive power to destroy all the targets in a line. Thanks to the outstanding work of our spy, the positions of all opponents¡¯ bases had been detected and marked on the map, consequently, the bombing plan will be sent to you.<br>Specifically, the map is expressed as a 2D-plane with some positions of enemy¡¯s bases marked on. The bombers are dispatched orderly and each of them will bomb a vertical or horizontal line on the map. Then your commanded wants you to report that how many bases will be destroyed by each bomber. Notice that a ruined base will not be taken into account when calculating the exploits of later bombers.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>Multiple test cases and each test cases starts with two non-negative integer N (N&lt;=100,000) and M (M&lt;=100,000) denoting the number of target bases and the number of scheduled bombers respectively. In the following N line, there is a pair of integers x and y separated by single space indicating the coordinate of position of each opponent¡¯s base. The following M lines describe the bombers, each of them contains two integers c and d where c is 0 or 1 and d is an integer with absolute value no more than 10<sup>9</sup>, if c = 0, then this bomber will bomb the line x = d, otherwise y = d. The input will end when N = M = 0 and the number of test cases is no more than 50.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>For each test case, output M lines, the ith line contains a single integer denoting the number of bases that were destroyed by the corresponding bomber in the input.
