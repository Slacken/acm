As is true to its name, the game communicates in binary, so that one button represents a zero and the other a one.  Even more true to its name, the game chooses to communicate so that the base of the number system is minus two, not plus two, so we¡¯ll call this representation ¡°Weird Binary¡±.  Thus the bit positions label the powers of minus two, as seen in the following five-bit tables: <br><img src=/data/images/C127_1006_1.jpg><br>Numbers are presented on the screen in Weird Binary, and then numbers are accepted in response from the console as a stream of zeroes and ones, terminated by a five-second pause.<br>You are writing a computer program to support the novice geek in playing the game by translating numbers between decimal and Weird Binary.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>The first line in the file gives the number of problems being posed without any white space.  Following are that many lines.  Each line will either be a conversion into Weird Binary or out of Weird Binary:  the letter &quot;b&quot; indicates that the rest of the line is written in Weird Binary and needs to be converted to decimal;  the letter &quot;d&quot; indicates that the rest of the line is written in decimal and needs to be converted to Weird Binary.<br>The input data are in the range to fit within a 15-bit Weird Binary number, which represents the decimal number range ¨C10922 to 21845, inclusive.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>For each conversion problem, show the type of problem, its input string, and the converted result in the format shown below, replicating even the spacing exactly as shown.
