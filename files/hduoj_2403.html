This forms a &quot;human knot&quot; since the players' arms are most likely intertwined. The goal is then to unwind the knot to form a circle of players with no arms crossed. <br><br>We now adapt this game to a more general and more abstract setting where the physical constraints of the problem are gone. Suppose we represent the initial knot with a 2-regular graph inscribed in a circle (i.e., we have a graph with n vertices with exactly two edges incident on each vertex). Initially, some edges may cross other edges and this is undesirable. This is the &quot;knot&quot; we wish to unwind. <br><br>A &quot;move&quot; involves moving any vertex to a new position on the circle, keeping its edges intact. Our goal is to make the fewest possible moves such that we obtain one n-sided polygon with no edge-crossings remaining. <br><br>For example, here is a knot on 4 vertices inscribed in a circle, but two edges cross each other. By moving vertex 4 down to the position between 2 and 3, a graph without edge-crossings emerges. This was achieved in a single move, which is clearly optimal in this case. <br><center><img src=../../../data/images/C137-1004-1.jpg></center><br>When n is larger, things may not be quite as clear. Below we see a knot on 6 vertices. We might consider moving vertex 4 between 5 and 6, then vertex 5 between 1 and 2, and finally vertex 6 between 3 and 4; this unwinds the knot in 3 moves.<br><center><img src=../../../data/images/C137-1004-2.jpg></center><br>But clearly we can unwind the same knot in only two moves: <br><center><img src=../../../data/images/C137-1004-3.jpg></center><br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>The input consists of a number of cases. Each case starts with a line containing the integer n (3 &lt;= n &lt;= 500), giving the number of vertices of the graph. The vertices are labelled clockwise from 1 to n. Each of the next n lines gives a pair of neighbors, where line i (1 &lt;= i &lt;= n) specifies the two vertices adjacent to vertex i. The input is terminated by n = 0. <br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>For each case, if there is no solution, print &quot;Not solvable.&quot; on a line by itself.
