                           <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John von Neumann, b. Dec. 28, 1903, d. Feb. 8, 1957, was a Hungarian-American mathematician who made important contributions to the foundations of mathematics, logic, quantum physics, meteorology, science, computers, and game theory. He was noted for a phenomenal memory and the speed with which he absorbed ideas and solved problems. In 1925 he received a B.S. diploma in chemical engineering from Zurich Institute and in 1926 a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Budapest, His Ph.D. dissertation on set theory was an important contributions to the subject.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the age of 20, von Neumann proposed a new definition of ordinal numbers that was universally adopted. While still in his twenties, he made many contributions in both pure and applied mathematics that established him as a mathematician of unusual depth. His Mathematical Foundation of Quantum Mechanics (1932) built a solid framework for the new scientific discipline.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this time he also proved the mini-max theorem of GAME THEORY. He gradually expanded his work in game theory, and with coauthor Oskar Morgenstern he wrote Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (1944).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are some numbers which can be expressed by the sum of factorials. For example 9, 9 = 1! + 2! + 3! . Dr. von Neumann was very interested in such numbers. So, he gives you a number n, and wants you to tell whether or not the number can be expressed by the sum of some factorials.<br />
Well, it is just a piece of case. For a given n, you will check if there are some xi, and let n equal to &Sigma;t (上标) i=1（下标） xi! (t&ge;1, xi&ge;0, xi = xj &lt;==&gt; i = j)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;即 &Sigma;&nbsp; xi! (t&ge;1, xi&ge;0, xi = xj &lt;==&gt; i = j)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; i=1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the answer is yes, say &quot;YES&quot;; otherwise, print out &quot;NO&quot;.</p>

                           <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will get a non-negative integer n (n&le;1,000,000) from input file.</p>

                           <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the n in the input file, you should print exactly one word (&quot;YES&quot; or &quot;NO&quot;) in a single line. No extra spaces are allowed.</p>
