But opening the gate isn't an easy task.<br><br>There were n buttons list in a straight line in front of the gate and each with an integer on it. Like other puzzles the hero had solved before, if all buttons had been pressed <br>down in any moment, the gate would open. So, in order to solve the puzzle, the hero must press all the button one by one.<br><br> After some trials, the hero found that those buttons he had pressed down would pop up after a while before he could press all the buttons down. He soon realized that <br>the integer on the button is the time when the button would automatic pop up after pressing it, in units of second. And he measured the distance between every button<br> and the first button, in units of maximum distance the hero could reach per second. Even with this information, the hero could not figure out in what order he should <br>press the buttons. So you talent programmers, are assigned to help him solve the puzzle.<br><br>To make the puzzle easier, assuming that the hero always took integral seconds to go from one button to another button and he took no time turnning around or pressing <br>a button down. And the hero could begin from any button.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>The input file would contain multiple cases.

In the second sample, no matter which button the hero pressed first, the button would always pop up before he press the other button. So there is no way to make all
 the button pressed down.
