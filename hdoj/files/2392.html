Although they are strictly pacifistic they have means of defense. Their cryptographers are able to routinely decrypt the commands sent to Googol¡¯s robots and they can ¨C using huge amounts of energy ¨C construct bogus commands. It is the job of the Tactical Unit Defense (TUD) to find the best way to interfere with the command transmission from Googol.<br><br>You are given a string of movements (each being a step to the north, east, south or west) and a map containing an invading robot from Googol and, possibly, several obstacles and traps.<br>Your task is to find a way to overcome the threat by changing as few movements as possible and guiding the robot into a trap. A single change replaces a step by another direction or no movement at all.<br>A robot will move in the given direction if the position is not blocked or outside the given map. If given such a direction, the robot does not move instead.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>The first line contains the number of scenarios. For each scenario a line containing two integers 1 &lt;= w; h &lt;= 100 separated by a single space is given, followed by h lines each containing w characters. This is a map of the area.<br>Exactly one character is a R which is the starting position of the invading robot. Other characters are ¡®.¡¯ to denote free positions, X to denote blocked positions and + to denote traps.<br>This is followed by a line containing an integer 0 &lt;= c &lt;= 100 and another line containing c characters of communication. Each character is either N, E, S or W to denote a command to move one position up, right, down or left, respectively.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>The output for every scenario begins with a line containing ¡°Scenario #i:¡±, where i is the number of the scenario starting at 1.<br>Then print on a single line the string of movements (denoted by characters N, E, S, W and, for no movement, X) that leads into a trap, of those the one that changes as few characters as possible, of those the one that leads into a trap as early as possible, of those the lexicographically first. This string must have c characters.<br>If no such string exists, output ¡°impossible¡± on a single line. Terminate the output for the scenario with a blank line.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Input</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">3
