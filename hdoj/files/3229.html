Large number of players put themselves in it day after days¡­<br><br>JinYueTuan is a simple game with these rules:<br>Only seven keys on the keyboard will be used in games, each key are assigned to one of the seven sound tracks. During the game, a series of notes may fall in each sound track irregularly. When notes fall down in one sound track, player should press the assigned key at once. If so, then got a ¡°Cool¡±, or get ¡°Miss¡± otherwise.<br><br>There are two types of ¡°Note¡±: ¡°single note¡± and ¡°strip note¡±. Just as the name implies, ¡°single note¡± means a single note, press right key at the right time once, then you can get a ¡°Cool¡±, otherwise ¡°Miss¡±; ¡°strip note¡± needs you keeping press the corresponding key from the start time to the end time of the note. Press key at the begin time you may get a ¡°Cool¡±, and release at the end time to get another ¡°Cool¡±, you will ¡°Miss¡± either early or late. If ¡°Miss¡± at the begin time, then ¡°Miss¡± the other (the end time) immediately.<br><br>People lament about the fact that such an easy game is limited by the hardware design, the so-called ¡°keys confliction¡±. ¡°keys confliction¡± means some key combinations cannot be pressed. For example, when Track 1,4,5,6 fall a note at the same time respectively, we should press the four keys at the same time, but now, keys confliction may happen, and cause this to fail, then you will ¡°Miss¡± all these four notes. Keys confliction meets the relation of inclusion, in other words, if keys set S would cause the confliction, so would keys set T when S is included in T. Note that, if at a certain moment in time, some keys should be pressed and some pressing keys should be released, then you can release and press at the same time, and released keys won¡¯t cause any keys confliction at all.<br><br>Because of the keys confliction, we have to give up some notes to save as more other notes as possible. More details will be explained in the sample data.<br><br>Now you know the falling time and type (single or strip) of each note in each sound track, and all keys-assembling that may cause confliction. Your task is to calculate the maximum number of ¡°Cool¡± that player can get.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>There are multiple test cases, the number of them T is given in the very first line, followed by T cases.<br><br>For each test case:<br>First line contains an integer N, the length of the music (1¡ÜN¡Ü1000).<br>The next 7 lines will contain description of each sound track. The first number in each line, C, denote the number of notes in that sound track. Following C description of each note: A single number ¡°A¡± denotes an single note at Time A(1¡ÜA¡ÜN); A pair of integers separating by ¡®-¡¯,¡±A-B¡± denotes a strip note start at Time A and end at Time B(1¡ÜA&lt;B¡ÜN). In each sound track, no superposition exists, no strip starts at another¡¯s end time, no single notes puts in a strip(includes begin and end point).<br><br>The next line contain a single integer K (0¡ÜK&lt;2<sup>7</sup>), denotes K descriptions of Keys Confliction are following.<br><br>Each description is a single line containing a string of seven characters S0 S1 S2¡­S6, if Sk1,Sk2,¡­,Sks were character ¡®1¡¯ and others were ¡®0¡¯, that means key combination Sk1Sk2¡­Sks may cause Keys Confliction.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>For each test case, output one line containing integer P with case number, the maximum number of ¡°Cool¡± players can get.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Input</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">3
