But the game we play here is rather easy. It just contains three suits: stones, bamboos and characters.<br>Stones consist of a number of circles. Each circle is said to represent can (Í², t¨®ng) coins with a square hole in the middle.<br><center><img src=../../../data/images/3391-1.png></center> <br>Bamboos consist of a number of bamboo sticks. Each stick is said to represent a string (Ë÷, su¨¯) that holds a hundred coins. Note that 1 Bamboo is an exception: it has a bird sitting on a bamboo, to prevent alteration.<br><center><img src=../../../data/images/3391-2.png></center> <br>Each character represents ten thousand (Èf, w¨¤n) coins.<br><center><img src=../../../data/images/3391-3.png></center> <br>A player wins the round by creating a standard mahjong hand, which consists of a certain number of melds (namely, four for 13-tile variations) and a pair. A meld is three tiles which are adjacent in one suit or all the same. A pair is two same tiles.<br>Now one player has three tiles in hand. Can you tell what more tile he need to win?<br>Note that the number of each tile in Mahjong is four. So if the number of one tile the player has is four, he cannot get this tile anymore.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>The first line contains one integer T indicating the number of test cases.<br>For each case, there are thirteen tiles in one line, separated by one space.<br>Each tile has two characters.

Hint
In case 3, if the player gets 1s, he can combine them into four melds (1s1s1s, 1s2s3s, 4s5s6s, 7s8s9s) and a pair (9s9s). And so it is with 2s to 9s.
2s: 1s1s1s, 3s4s5s, 6s7s8s, 9s9s9s, 2s2s
