A lot of student want to get back to school by train(because the trains in the Ignatius Train Station is the fastest all over the world ^v^). But here comes a problem, there is only one railway where all the trains stop. So all the trains come in from one side and get out from the other side. For this problem, if train A gets into the railway first, and then train B gets into the railway before train A leaves, train A can't leave until train B leaves. The pictures below figure out the problem. Now the problem for you is, there are at most 9 trains in the station, all the trains has an ID(numbered from 1 to n), the trains get into the railway in an order O1, your task is to determine whether the trains can get out in an order O2.<br><img src=/data/images/1022-1.jpg><img src=/data/images/1022-2.jpg><img src=/data/images/1022-3.jpg></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>The input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of an integer, the number of trains, and two strings, the order of the trains come in:O1, and the order of the trains leave:O2. The input is terminated by the end of file.

Print a line contains &quot;FINISH&quot; after each test case.

For the first Sample Input, we let train 1 get in, then train 2 and train 3.
So now train 3 is at the top of the railway, so train 3 can leave first, then train 2 and train 1.
In the second Sample input, we should let train 3 leave first, so we have to let train 1 get in, then train 2 and train 3.
Now we can let train 3 leave.
But after that we can't let train 1 leave before train 2, because train 2 is at the top of the railway at the moment.
So we output "No.".</div></pre></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Author</div> <div class=panel_content>Ignatius.L</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><center style='font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#1A5CC8'><a href='statistic.php?pid=1022'>Statistic</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href='submit.php?pid=1022'>Submit</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="./discuss/problem/list.php?problemid=1022">Discuss</a> | <a href='note/note.php?pid=1022'>Note</a><br></td></tr></div></body></html>
