The training courses lasts exactly N continuous days. There are M lecturers and each day there may be some lecturers talking abort different topics at different time. Each lecturer has a fixed time to make a lecture and the order of the lecturer is fixed. The following is a sample schedule (for example, the first record in the second rows means that daxia has to give a lecture at day 1,4,5 and On ¡°Day 1¡±  there are 4 lecturers making a lecture: daxia at class 1,AekdyCoin at class 4,bluewind at class 6,forza at class 7):<center><img src=../../data/images/3438-1.jpg></center> The training courses are very popular and there are a lot people want to attend the courses. So being the manager of the courses, LL wants to repeat the training courses S times. But as you know, our lecturers are very busy and they want the training finish as early as possible. So could you write a program to calculate the minimum days it needs to finish all the training?Here is a simple example to help you understand the problem:<center><img src=../../data/images/3438-2.jpg></center>There are two lecturers (daxia and yayamao), and the training courses last exactly 2 days.<br>Now suppose S=2, then one possible schedule may be (Note that schedule here is for all training courses, so here Day 3 is the first day of the second training, i.e.Day 3 is the ¡°Day 1¡± of second training):<center><img src=../../data/images/3438-3.jpg></center>It cost 4 days in total. But we can do it better, we can rearrange the courses as following:<center><img src=../../data/images/3438-4.jpg></center> Now it only cost 3 days and it¡¯s the best schedule we can achieve.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>In the first line there is an integer T, indicates the number of test cases.(T&lt;=100)<br>In each case, there is one line contains three integer numbers M,N,S(1&lt;=M&lt;=20, 1&lt;=N&lt;=8,1&lt;=S&lt;=10^6) , indicating the number of the lecturers, the total days of the training course and the repeating times of the training courses. Then following M lines, each line contains N integers of ¡®0¡¯ or ¡®1¡¯. If the j-th integer is &quot;1&quot; at the i-th line, it means lecturer i should make a lecture on day j.There will be at least one ¡®1¡¯ in each case.You should note that the order of the lecturers and the time interval between each lectures should not be changed in each training.<br>There may be some blank lines between each cases.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>For each test case , output ¡°Case d: ¡° first where d is the case number counted from one, then output the minimum days it need to finish all the training. </div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Input</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">2
