Out of nowhere, a breath-taking beautiful girl came by, Daizhenyang was shocked by her beauty and was too stunned to say hi.<br>There's an old saying, &quot;Once there was true love for me but I did not cherish it. When it slipped away between my fingers, I began to regret. That is the saddest thing in life. If God could give me a second chance, I would tell the girl 'I love you!'. If there should be a time limit on this love, I wish it would be 10000 years.&quot; Regretting is what Daizhengyang is being through. He wants to make everything right, so he figured out her mail address and decides to send a love letter.<br>After thinking again and again for a long time, Daizhenyang picked up some keywords to express his love and emotion. However, Daizhenyang is busy on his eternal lasting enterprise, unifying all kinds of ACM/ICPC problems to network flow, he wants to make this letter as short as possible.
