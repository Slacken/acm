So, he decide to invent a new language to reduce the burden on students. <br><br>This new language only support four data type, but the syntax is an strict subset of C. It only support assignment operation, brackets operation , addition , subtration, multiplication and division between variables and numbers. The priority of operations is the same as C. <br><br>In order to void the problem of forgetting the eliminator &quot;;&quot;, this new language allow to omit it. <br><br>The variable naming rules is the same as C. <br><br>Comments is not allowed in this language. <br><br>Now Prof.X need to impelment this language, and the variable part is done by himself. Now Prof.X need you, a execllent ACM coder's help: Given a section of this language's code, please calculate it's return value. </div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>The input contains many lines, each line is a section of codes written in the language described above, you can assume that all variables have been declared as int and have been set to 0 initially. </div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>To each line of input, output an integer indicate the return value of the input line. the semicolon will only appear in the end of line, you can assume that every literal, variable's value and the intermediate results of calculation would never bigger than a short integer. <br><br>Notice: the result may affect by assignment operation, if you don't know the exact return value of some statements such as a=3, you can try run codes such as ' printf(&quot;%d&quot;,a=3); ' in C, and check the result. </div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Input</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">a=3
