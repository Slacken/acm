In this problem, the contents of the tree will be ignored, and you will be asked about the effect the heuristic has on the structure of the tree.<br><br>A binary tree is either empty or consists of a node with a left child and a right child, where each of the children are also binary trees. No node has more than one parent, and there are no cycles. In any non-empty tree, there is exactly one node without a parent, which is called the root of the tree.<br><br>The rotate-to-root heuristic takes effect when a node in the tree, say X, is accessed. While X is not the root of the tree, the following procedure is executed:<br><ul><li>If X is the left child of its parent, a right tree rotation is performed. Let P be the parent of X, let A be X's left child, let B be X's right child, and let C be the right child of P. Then, P is replaced in the tree by X, so P's parent (if any) becomes X's parent; X's right child becomes P's left child (which replaces X); and P replaces X's right child.

Let P be the parent of X, let A be the left child of P, let be B be X's left child, and let C be X's right child. Then, P is replaced in the tree by X, so P's parent (if any) becomes X's parent; X's left child becomes P's right child (which replaces X); and P replaces X's left child. Diagram:<br><br><center><img src=../../../data/images/C240-1005-1.jpg></center></li></ul><br>Tree rotations preserve the order of the nodes in the tree, which is why they are useful, but that is not important for this problem. <br><br>The height of a binary tree is the longest length of a path from its root to the bottom of the tree. More formally, the height of the empty tree is 0, and the height of a non-empty tree that has a root node X with children A and B is 1 + max{height(A), height(B)}.<br><br>Given a binary tree, you must determine, for each node X, what the height of the tree would be after X is rotated to root.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>Input consists of a number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains the integer <i>N</i>, the number of nodes in the binary tree, where 1 &lt;= <i>N</i> &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup>.<br><br>The following <i>N</i> lines of input each contain two integers. The <i>i</i><sup>th</sup> pair of these integers is <i>l<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>r<sub>i</sub></i>, the left and right children of node <i>i</i>. If <i>l<sub>i</sub></i> = 0, then the left child of node <i>i</i> is the empty tree, and if <i>r<sub>i</sub></i> = 0, then the right child of node <i>i</i> is the empty tree. Otherwise, 1 &lt;= <i>l</i>, <i>r</i> &lt;= <i>N</i>.<br><br>It is guaranteed that the input will describe a binary tree.<br><br>The last test case is followed by a line containing the integer 0.
