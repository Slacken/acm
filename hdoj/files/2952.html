I used to lie awake, staring at the ceiling, for hours and hours. Then one day my grandmother suggested I tried counting sheep after I'd gone to bed. As always when my grandmother suggests things, I decided to try it out. The only problem was, there were no sheep around to be counted when I went to bed.<br><center><img src=../../../data/images/con211-1007-1.jpg></center> <br><br>Creative as I am, that wasn't going to stop me. I sat down and wrote a computer program that made a grid of characters, where # represents a sheep, while . is grass (or whatever you like, just not sheep). To make the counting a little more interesting, I also decided I wanted to count flocks of sheep instead of single sheep. Two sheep are in the same flock if they share a common side (up, down, right or left). Also, if sheep A is in the same flock as sheep B, and sheep B is in the same flock as sheep C, then sheeps A and C are in the same flock.<br><br><br>Now, I've got a new problem. Though counting these sheep actually helps me fall asleep, I find that it is extremely boring. To solve this, I've decided I need another computer program that does the counting for me. Then I'll be able to just start both these programs before I go to bed, and I'll sleep tight until the morning without any disturbances. I need you to write this program for me.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>The first line of input contains a single number T, the number of test cases to follow.<br><br>Each test case begins with a line containing two numbers, H and W, the height and width of the sheep grid.
