Each of the nine rows must contain every positive digits exactly once, as do each column and also each 3x3 unit. The puzzle is to start from a partially filled 9x9 grid and to fill in the remaining cells using only logic. The puzzle maker usually makes sure that the solution will be unique and that it can be reached using deduction only, without guessing.<br><center><img src=../../../data/images/C236-1002-1.JPG></center><br>This number placing game is gaining popularity in the west, and every second newspaper publishes weekly instances of the puzzle. Somewhere at the head of one such newspaper, someone decided that buying individual instances from a puzzle maker would be too expansive, and instead decided to steal puzzles from other newspapers and also to print randomly generated Sudoku-like grids.<br><br>One week later, his assistant gets stuck with the job of printing the solution to the Sudoku puzzles his boss previously published. Unfortunately, his boss doesn¡¯t have those solutions, the randomly generated problems don¡¯t have any solution, and he doesn¡¯t even remember which is which. In despair, the assistant calls for your help.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>The first line of the input will contain the number of test cases. Each test case will consist of a 9 by 9 grid of characters, where each character will either be ¡®?¡¯ or a digit between 1 and 9 inclusively.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>For each test case, you must print back the grid to the standard input, replacing each question mark with an appropriate digit to solve the Sudoku. If a test case does not allow any solution, output ¡±impossible¡± instead of a completed grid. If a test case do allow a solution, you can assume that the solution will be unique, and that theoretically it could be reached without guessing.<br><br>Test cases are separated by ¡°---¡± both in the input and in the output.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Input</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">3
