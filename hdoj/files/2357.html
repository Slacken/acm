These files generally have a canonical<br>location, known as the absolute path (such as /usr/games/bin/kobodl), which can be used to refer to the file no matter where the user is on a<br>system.<br><br>Most operating system environments allow you to refer to files in other directories without having to be so explicit about their locations, however.<br>This is often stored in a variable called PATH, and is an ordered list of locations (always absolute paths in this problem) to search for a given name.<br>We will call these search paths.<br><br>In the brand-new crash shell, paths are handled somewhat differently. Users still provide an ordered list of locations that they wish to search for files<br>(their search paths); when a particular filename is requested, however, crash tries to be even more helpful than usual. The process it follows is as<br>follows:<br><br>If there is an exact match for the filename, it is returned. Exact matches in locations earlier in the list are preferred. (There are no duplicate<br>filenames in a single location.)<br>If there are no exact matches, a filename that has a single extra character is returned. That character may be at any point in the filename, but<br>the order of the non-extra characters must be identical to the requested filename. As before, matches in locations earlier in the list are<br>preferred; if there are multiple matches in the highest-ranked location, all such matches in that location are returned.<br>If there are no exact matches or one-extra-character matches, files that have two extra characters are looked for. The same rules of precedence<br>and multiple matches apply as for the one-extra-character case.<br>If no files meet the three criteria above, no filenames are returned. Two characters is considered the limit of &quot;permissiveness&quot; for the crash<br>shell.<br><br>So, for example, given the two files bang and tang, they are both one character away from the filename ang and two from ag. (All characters in this<br>problem will be lowercase.) In the sample data below, both cat and rat are one character away from at.<br><br>Given a complete list of locations and files in those locations on a system, a set of users each with their own ordered lists of search paths, and a set of<br>files that they wish to search for, what filenames would crash return?<br><br>For the purposes of simplification, all locations will be described by a single alphabetic string, as will filenames and usernames. Real operating<br>system paths often have many components separated by characters such as slashes, but this problem does not. Also note that users may accidentally<br>refer to nonexistent locations in their search paths; these (obviously) contain no files.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>All alphabetic strings in the input will have at least one and at most 20 characters, and will contain no special characters such as slashes or spaces; all<br>letters will be lowercase.<br><br>Input to this problem will begin with a line containing a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) indicating the number of data sets. Each data set consists of<br>the following components:<br><br>A line containing a single integer F (1 ≤ F ≤ 100) indicating the number of files on the system;<br>A series of F lines representing the files on the system, in the format &quot;location filename&quot;, where location and filename are both alphabetic<br>strings;<br>A line containing a single integer U (1 ≤ U ≤ 10) indicating the number of users on the system;<br>A series of U stanzas representing the users. Each stanza consists of the following components:<br>A line containing a single alphabetic string which is the user'susername;<br>A line containing a single integer L (1 ≤ L ≤ 10) representing the number of locations in the user's search path; and<br>A series of L lines containing a single alphabetic string apiece listing the locations in the user's search path. The first one is the highest<br>priority, the second (if present) is the second-highest priority, and so on.<br>A line containing a single integer S (1 ≤ S ≤ 200) indicating the number of file searches to run;<br>A series of S lines representing the searches, in the format &quot;username filename&quot;, where username is an alphabetic string that matches one of<br>the users defined in the data set, and filename is an alphabetic string that represents the requested filename.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>For each data set in the input, output the heading &quot;DATA SET #k&quot; where k is 1 for the first data set, 2 for the second, etc. Then for each of the S<br>searches in the data set (and in the same order as read from the input) do the following:<br><br>Print the line &quot;username REQUESTED filename&quot; where filename is the file requested by username.<br>For each file (if any) that matches this search, print the line &quot;FOUND filename IN location&quot; where filename is the file that matched the user's<br>request and that was found in location. The list of matching files must be sorted in alphabetical order by filename.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Input</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">1
