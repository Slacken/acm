The job is interesting, well paid and nice in many <br>aspects, except for the company is a little far from home. So YY has to take bus to work every day early in the morning, and prays for no traffic jams along the road.<br><br>The route of the bus is fixed. It goes past N+1 landmarks one by one, the first of which is the bus-stop where YY gets on the bus, and the last is the company<br> where he should get off. If traffic jams do not occur, the time consumed to go between landmarks is also fixed ¡ª Ti minutes from ith landmark to (i+1)th <br>landmark (1¡Üi¡ÜN). However, if a traffic jam is encountered, things are different. After having been late for many times (and luckily enough not been fired by his<br> boss &amp; girlfriend LMY), YY has discovered that the road between two consecutive landmarks will be jammed only in a fixed time period in a day. If the bus is <br>between ith landmark and (i+1)th landmark (excluding at the two landmarks themselves) and encounters a traffic jam, additional Di minutes are needed to<br> get to (i+1)th landmark.<br><br>Given the time YY gets on the bus and the time his company start to work, could he reach the company in time?</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>For each test case, the first line contains only one integer N. (1¡ÜN¡Ü100)<br>Then N lines follow. The ith line of which describes the road between ith landmark and (i+1)th landmark. Two integers comes first, Ti and Di (1¡ÜTi , Di¡Ü60), indicating <br>the basic time consumption and additional time consumption with traffic jam for the bus to go between the two landmarks, in minutes. A pair of time Si and Ei follows, <br>in HH:MM format (24 hours), indicating the starting and ending time of traffic jam between the two landmarks. Si is always strictly earlier than Ei, and they are always<br> in the same day.<br><br>The last line contains the time when YY gets on the bus and the time when the company starts to work, in HH:MM format (24 hours).

In the first test case, the bus starts at 07:20 and arrives at the company at 07:30, just avoids to be blocked by the traffic jam.

In the second test case, the bus start at 07:21 and encounters traffic jam at 07:30 when it is still on the way to the company. So additional 20 minutes are needed,
 and it arrives at the company at 07:51. So poor YY is just late, because he doesn¡¯t reach the company before 07:51, when it starts to work.

In the third test case, the bus arrives at the company at 00:00 in the second day, so he is considered to be late for almost one entire day.
