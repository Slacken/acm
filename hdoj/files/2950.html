A BSC transmits a sequence of bits, but each transmitted bit has a probability p of being fiipped to the wrong bit. This is called the crossover probability, as can be understood from the figure. We assume independent behaviour on difierent bits, so a communication of l bits has probability (1 - p)^l of being transmitted<br>correctly. Note that one can always assume that p &lt; 1/2, since a channel with p = 1/2 is totally useless, and a channel with p &gt; 1/2 can easily be transformed to a new channel having crossover probability 1 - p by just flipping all bits of the output.<br><br><br>Of course, it is still possible to communicate over a noisy channel. (In fact, you are doing it all the time!) To be able to do this, one has to add extra bits in order for the receiver to detect or even possibly correct errors. Example implementations of such a feature are parity bits, Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRC) and Golay codes. <br><br>These are not relevant to this problem, however, so they will not be discussed here.<br><br>In this problem you must investigate the behaviour of a binary symmetric channel.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>The first line of the input consists of a single number T, the number of transmissions.<br><br>Then follow T lines with the input and the output of each transmission as binary strings, separated by a single space.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>For each transmission, output OK if the communication was transmitted correctly, or ERROR if it was transmitted incorrectly.<br><br>Notes and Constraints<br> <br>0 &lt; T &lt;= 100<br><br> All inputs and outputs has length less than 120.<br><br> T is encoded in decimal.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Input</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">2
