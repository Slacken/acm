The j-th number of the i-th rows stands for the profit you will get if you ship from city i to cit j. with the same format the next N*N number give the time to finish that trip. p<sub>ij</sub> would be a integer that lies between -1000 and 10000 and The profit p<sub>ij</sub> doesn¡¯t have to be same with p<sub>ji</sub>, because cities have different demands. This is also holds for t<sub>ij</sub> and t<sub>ji</sub> maybe because the weather. t<sub>ij</sub> would also be an integer lies between 1 and 1000.
