In order to reach the destination safely on time, you are asked to develop a system which has two types of main functions as below.<br>1: A B C D, reporting whether we can get from station A to station B without passing the railway that connects station C and station D.<br>2: A B C, reporting whether we can get from station A to station B without passing station C.<br>Please notice that the railways are UNDIRECTED.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>For each test case, the first line will contain two integers N (2&lt;=N&lt;=100000) and M (1&lt;=M&lt;=500000), namely the number of stations and railways in TC. Then each of the next M lines will have two integers, describing the two stations that a certain railway is connecting. After this, there comes a line containing a single integer Q (Q&lt;=300000), which means the number of queries to make on the system. The next Q lines will be queries. Each query begins with a integer, indicating the type of query, followed by 4 (the first type) or 3 (the second type) integers describing the details of the query as what mentioned above.<br>The stations are always labeled from 1 to N.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>For each test case, print &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; in separated lines for the queries.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Input</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">13 15
