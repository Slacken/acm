You assume that the shuffle algorithm of your music player makes a random permutation of the songs in the playlist and plays the songs in that order until all songs have been played. Then it reshuffles and starts playing the list again.<br><br>You have a history of the songs that have been played. However, your record of the history of played songs is not complete, as you started recording songs at a certain point in time and a number of songs might already have been played. From this history, you want to know at how many different points in the future the next reshuffle might occur.<br><br>A potential future reshuffle position is valid if it divides the recorded history into intervals of length s (the number of songs in the playlist) with the first and last interval possibly containing less than s songs and no interval contains a specific song more than once. </div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>On the first line one positive number: the number of testcases, at most 100. After that per testcase:<br><br>    * One line with two integers s and n (1 ¡Ü s, n ¡Ü 100000): the number of different songs in the playlist and the number of songs in the recorded playlist history.<br>    * One line with n space separated integers, x1, x2, ..., xn (1 ¡Ü xi ¡Ü s): the recorded playlist history. </div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>Per testcase:<br><br>    * One line with the number of future positions the next reshuffle can be at. If the history could not be generated by the above mentioned algorithm, output 0. </div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Input</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">4
