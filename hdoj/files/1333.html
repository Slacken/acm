Smith had the following peculiar property: The sum of the digits of that number was equal to the sum of the digits of the prime factors of that number. Got it? Smith¡¯s telephone number was 493-7775. This number can be written as the product of its prime factors in the following way: <br><br><center>4937775 = 3 * 5 * 5 * 65837</center><br>The sum of all digits of the telephone number is 4+9+3+7+7+7+5= 42?, and the sum of the digits of its prime factors is equally 3+5+5+6+5+8+3+7= 42. Wilansky was so amazed by his discovery that he named this kind of numbers after his brother-in-law: Smith numbers.<br><br>As this observation is also true for every prime number, Wilansky decided later that a (simple and unsophisticated) prime number is not worth being a Smith number, so he excluded them from the definition.<br><br>Wilansky published an article about Smith numbers in the Two Year College Mathematics Journal and was able to present a whole collection of different Smith numbers: For example, 9985 is a Smith number and so is 6036. However,Wilansky was not able to find a Smith number that was larger than the telephone number of his brother-in-law. It is your task to find Smith numbers that are larger than 4937775!<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>The input consists of a sequence of positive integers, one integer per line.
