'What do we have to do?' <br>They stepped over the threshold and immediately a fire sprang up beind them in the doorway. It wasn't ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onwards.They were trapped. <br>'Look!' Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles.
