Thousands of people are rushing to the cinema. However, this is really a tuff time for Joe who sells the film tickets. He is wandering when could he go back home as early as possible.<br>A good approach, reducing the total time of tickets selling, is let adjacent people buy tickets together. As the restriction of the Ticket Seller Machine, Joe can sell a single ticket or two adjacent tickets at a time.<br>Since you are the great JESUS, you know exactly how much time needed for every person to buy a single ticket or two tickets for him/her. Could you so kind to tell poor Joe at what time could he go back home as early as possible? If so, I guess Joe would full of appreciation for your help.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>There are N(1&lt;=N&lt;=10) different scenarios, each scenario consists of 3 lines:<br>1) An integer K(1&lt;=K&lt;=2000) representing the total number of people;<br>2) K integer numbers(0s&lt;=Si&lt;=25s) representing the time consumed to buy a ticket for each person;<br>3) (K-1) integer numbers(0s&lt;=Di&lt;=50s) representing the time needed for two adjacent people to buy two tickets together.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>For every scenario, please tell Joe at what time could he go back home as early as possible.
