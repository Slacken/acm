The grid has four dials (labeled ``A&quot; to ``D&quot; in the figure.) Each dial can be rotated in 90 degrees increment in either direction. Rotating a dial causes the four cells currently adjacent to it to rotate along. For example, figure (b) shows the Tobo after rotating dial ``A&quot; once in a clockwise direction. Figure (c) shows the Tobo in figure (b) after rotating dial ``D&quot; once in a counterclockwise direction. <br><br><center><img src=../../../data/images/con208-1001-1.JPG></center><br><br><br>Kids love to challenge each other playing the Tobo. Starting with the arrangement shown in figure (a), (which we'll call the standard arrangement,) one kid would randomly rotate the dials, X  number of times, in order to ``shuffle&quot; the board. Another kid then tries to bring the board back to its standard arrangement, taking no more than X  rotations to do so. The less rotations are needed to restore it, the better. This is where you see a business opportunity. You would like to sell these kids a program to advise them on the minimum number of steps needed to bring a Tobo back to its standard arrangement. </div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>Your program will be tested on one or more test cases. Each test case is specified on a line by itself. Each line is made of 10 decimal digits. Let's call the first digit Y . The remaining 9 digits are non-zeros and describe the current arrangement of the Tobo in a row-major top-down, left-to-right ordering. The first sample case corresponds to figure (c).<br><br>The last line of the input file is a sequence of 10 zeros. </div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>For each test case, print the result using the following format:<br><br><br>k . R<br><br><br>where k is the test case number (starting at 1,) is a single space, and R is the minimum number of rotations needed to bring the Tobo back to its standard arrangement. If this can't be done in Y dials or less, then R = -1. </div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Input</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">3413569728
