Bus is an important transportation method in traditional public transportation system. And it¡¯s still playing an important role even now.<br>The bus system of City X is quite strange. Unlike other city¡¯s system, the cost of ticket is calculated based on the distance between the two stations. Here is a list which describes the relationship between the distance and the cost.<br><br><center><img src=../../../data/images/C116-1002-1.JPG></center><br><br>Your neighbor is a person who is a really miser. He asked you to help him to calculate the minimum cost between the two stations he listed. Can you solve this problem for him?<br>To simplify this problem, you can assume that all the stations are located on a straight line. We use x-coordinates to describe the stations¡¯ positions.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>The input consists of several test cases. There is a single number above all, the number of cases. There are no more than 20 cases.<br>Each case contains eight integers on the first line, which are L1, L2, L3, L4, C1, C2, C3, C4, each number is non-negative and not larger than 1,000,000,000. You can also assume that L1&lt;=L2&lt;=L3&lt;=L4.<br>Two integers, n and m, are given next, representing the number of the stations and questions. Each of the next n lines contains one integer, representing the x-coordinate of the ith station. Each of the next m lines contains two integers, representing the start point and the destination.<br>In all of the questions, the start point will be different from the destination.<br>For each case,2&lt;=N&lt;=100,0&lt;=M&lt;=500, each x-coordinate is between -1,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,000, and no two x-coordinates will have the same value.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>For each question, if the two stations are attainable, print the minimum cost between them. Otherwise, print ¡°Station X and station Y are not attainable.¡± Use the format in the sample.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Input</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">2
