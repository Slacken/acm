At that time, the kinds of gamble were not that much diversified. The gamble can only be performed in a way that two people played against each other and the one who lost the game would have to give the winner $1. Furthermore, the one who lose all his money and lose for another time would get out and never come back. But he still has to pay $1 (He may sell his pants). After playing for quite a long time, they felt as if they had their wings broken, for everyone still here won nothing. <br>As one of the gamblers, mzry1992 wondered what really happened. Now mzry1992 wants you to tell him what happened between some pairs, for example how much does gambler A win from gambler B directly. But actually you do not know the real situation. So you could just tell him one of the possible situations.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>There are T cases and the first line of the input contains the  number T. The first line of each case consists of one integer N(2 ¡ÜN¡Ü500), indicating the number of gamblers. Then comes N  lines. The i-th line is a non-negative integer smaller than 101  indicating the i-th gambler's initial possess. The next line  contains one integer M(0¡ÜM¡Ü10000), indicating the number of  pairs of gamblers who gambled. The following M line contains  three integer A, B, t(1¡ÜA, B¡ÜN, 1¡Üt¡Ü100), which means that the  gamble A and the gamble B played the game for t times. The  final part of each test case begins with an integer Q  (1¡ÜQ¡Ü200000). Then Q lines follows. Each line contains two  integers A, B. You are asked to answer how much gambler A  wins from B.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>Output the all the queries from mzry1992.For each test case, your answer should assume that all of the gambles could happen in the one situation.
