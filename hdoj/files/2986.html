Now, the results have been published, so Bill and Ted want to check who was right. But checking the results of their many friends would take a very long time, and they need the evaluation to be done by a computer. Since they are not so good at programming, they ask you for help. </div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>The data provided by Bill and Ted has the following format: The first line consists of the number p of parties followed by the number g of guesses (with 1 ¡Ü p ¡Ü 50 and 1 ¡Ü g ¡Ü 10000). Then follow p lines, each line consisting of a unique party name of length ¡Ü 20 (only containing letters a-z, A-Z and digits 0-9) and the achieved vote percentage of this party with one digit after the decimal point. After the parties follow g lines, each consisting of a guess. A guess has the form P<sub>1</sub> + P<sub>2</sub> + ... + P<sub>k</sub> COMP n, where P<sub>1</sub> to P<sub>k</sub> are party names, COMP is one of the comparison operators &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;= or = and n is an integer between 0 and 100, inclusively. Each party name occurs at most once in each guess. <br><br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>For each guess, sum up the vote percentages of the parties and compare them with the specified integer n. Then, print a line stating whether the guess was correct. See the sample output for details. <br><br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Input</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">6 5
