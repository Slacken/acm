There are n trees in the square. They are all so tall. Sophia is very interesting in them.<br><center><img src=../../../data/images/exe3015-1.JPG></center><br>    She finds that trees maybe disharmony and the Disharmony Value between two trees is associated with two value called FAR and SHORT.<br><br>    The FAR is defined as the following:If we rank all these trees according to their X Coordinates in ascending order.The tree with smallest X Coordinate is ranked 1th.The trees with the same X Coordinates are ranked the same. For example,if there are 5 tree with X Coordinates 3,3,1,3,4. Then their ranks may be 2,2,1,2,5. The FAR of two trees with X Coordinate ranks D1 and D2 is defined as F = abs(D1-D2).<br><br>    The SHORT is defined similar to the FAR. If we rank all these trees according to their heights in ascending order£¬the tree with shortest height is ranked 1th.The trees with the same heights are ranked the same. For example, if there are 5 tree with heights 4,1,9,7,4. Then their ranks may be 2,1,5,4,2. The SHORT of two trees with height ranks H1 and H2 is defined as S=min(H1,H2).<br><br>    Two tree¡¯s Disharmony Value is defined as F*S. So from the definition above we can see that, if two trees¡¯s FAR is larger , the Disharmony Value is bigger. And the Disharmony value is also associated with the shorter one of the two trees. <br><br>    Now give you every tree¡¯s X Coordinate and their height , Please tell Sophia the sum of every two trees¡¯s Disharmony value among all trees.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>There are several test cases in the input<br><br>    For each test case, the first line contain one integer N (2 &lt;= N &lt;= 100,000) N represents the number of trees.<br><br>    Then following N lines, each line contain two integers : X, H (0 &lt; X,H &lt;=1,000,000,000 ), indicating the tree is located in Coordinates X and its height is H.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>For each test case output the sum of every two trees¡¯s Disharmony value among all trees.
