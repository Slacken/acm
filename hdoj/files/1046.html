For some of them efficient algorithms are already available, these are the ¡°easy¡± problems like sorting, evaluating a polynomial or finding the shortest path in a graph. For the ¡°hard¡± ones only exponential-time algorithms are known. The traveling-salesman problem belongs to this latter group. Given a set of N towns and roads between these towns, the problem is to compute the shortest path allowing a salesman to visit each of the towns once and only once and return to the starting point.<br><br>The president of Gridland has hired you to design a program that calculates the length of the shortest traveling-salesman tour for the towns in the country. In Gridland, there is one town at each of the points of a rectangular grid. Roads run from every town in the directions North, Northwest, West, Southwest, South, Southeast, East, and Northeast, provided that there is a neighbouring town in that direction. The distance between neighbouring towns in directions North¨CSouth or East¨CWest is 1 unit. The length of the roads is measured by the Euclidean distance. For example, Figure 7 shows 2 ¡Á 3-Gridland, i.e., a rectangular grid of dimensions 2 by 3. In 2 ¡Á 3-Gridland, the shortest tour has length 6. <br><br><img src=/data/images/1046-1.jpg><br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>The first line contains the number of scenarios.<br><br>For each scenario, the grid dimensions m and n will be given as two integer numbers in a single line, separated by a single blank, satisfying 1 &lt; m &lt; 50 and 1 &lt; n &lt; 50.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>The output for each scenario begins with a line containing ¡°Scenario #i:¡±, where i is the number of the scenario starting at 1.
