Apart from the obvious demand for a centralised coordination of the cabs in order to pick up the customers calling to get a cab as soon as possible, there is also a need to schedule all the taxi rides which have been booked in advance. Given a list of all booked taxi rides for the next day, you want to minimise the number of cabs needed to carry out all of the rides. <br><br>For the sake of simplicity, we model a city as a rectangular grid. An address in the city is denoted by two integers: the street and avenue number. The time needed to get from the address a, b to c, d by taxi is |a &amp;#8722; c| + |b &amp;#8722; d| minutes. A cab may carry out a booked ride if it is its first ride of the day, or if it can get to the source address of the new ride from its latest , at least one minute before the new ride¡¯s scheduled departure. Note that some rides may end after midnight.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>On the first line of the input is a single positive integer N, telling the number of test scenarios to follow. Each scenario begins with a line containing an integer M, 0 &lt; M &lt; 500, being the number of booked taxi rides. The following M lines contain the rides. Each ride is described by a departure time on the format hh:mm (ranging from 00:00 to 23:59), two integers a b that are the coordinates of the source address and two integers c d that are the coordinates of the destination address. All coordinates are at least 0 and strictly smaller than 200. The booked rides in each scenario are sorted in order of increasing departure time.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>For each scenario, output one line containing the minimum number of cabs required to carry out all the booked taxi rides.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Input</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">2
