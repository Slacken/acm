Recently, Jiaoshou had cleared ¡°Need for Speed Undercover¡±. In this game, Jiaoshou acted as a spy. To prove that he is not a spy, Jiaoshou must do some evil things frequently. So lots of police cars often ran after him. In order to escape from the chase, Jiaoshou need to accelerate his Bugatti Veyron. <br> <br>To simplify this problem, we just assume that only one police car ran after Jiaoshou. And Bugatti Veyron¡¯s speed is vx. The police car¡¯s speed is vy. v is a function of first degree or a constant, as the form of a*m+b. In this form, m means the minute that the car has run.<br>Now Jiaoshou is S meters ahead. Jiaoshou like to know if he could escape from the chase. He want you to write a program to solve this problem.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>The input contains several tests. The first line of the input is a single integer T (T&lt;1000) which is the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.<br>Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains a single real number S (0&lt;S&lt;=10^6) , as the problem has described. The second line contains two real numbers ax, bx, indicating Bugatti Veyron¡¯s speed is ax*m+bx. The last line also contains two real numbers ay, by, indicating the police car¡¯s speed is ay*m+by. All numbers are range from -1000 to 1000, except S.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>If Jiaoshou can escape from the chase, please output ¡°Good driver,Jiaoshou!¡±.
