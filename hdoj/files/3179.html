We can buy a lot of things in supermarket. <br>Now in a city, the government has built two supermarkets. And the citizens want to know whether the sum of distance between their house and the supermarket is the smallest. Let¡¯s describe the problem more precisely. We define L1 is the distance from this house to supermarket A, L2 is the distance from this house to supermarket B, and D = L1 + L2. If there is no other house which has smaller D than this house, then this house is on the shortest road between supermarket A and supermarket B. Now the government needs your help to answer the citizen's question: Whether their house is built on the shortest path between supermarket A and supermarket B.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>The first line of input is a single integer T, indicating the number of test cases. Following that are exactly t cases. In each case, the first line contains two integers: N, the number of houses, and M, the number of roads. Then M lines will follow, each of which contains three integers A B C, indicating there is a road between place A and B, whose length is C. Please note that all roads are undirected. The last line contains two integers A, B (A != B) separated by a space, indicating the location of the two supermarket. The next line contains an integer Q, the number of questions that citizens had asked. Then Q lines follow, each line contain a integer p, indicate the number of the house. There is only one road between any pair of places. There must exists a path between two places.<br><br>1&lt;= T &lt;= 50;<br>5 &lt;= N &lt;= 100;<br>N ¨C 1 &lt;= M &lt;= (N * (N - 1)) / 2;<br>1&lt;= A, B, Q, Q&lt;= N;<br>1 &lt;= C &lt; 1000;<br><br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>For each test case, print Q lines, each of which you should print ¡±Yes¡± if this house is on the shortest road between supermarket A and supermarket B , or &quot;No&quot; otherwise.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Input</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">2
