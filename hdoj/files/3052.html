Due to its powerful function in code complete, compile, and error jump, it¡¯s widely used by programmers. The same as Emacs, it¡¯s the most popular text editor among users of UNIX. As such an excellent text editor, Vim has various of orders. Now, we¡¯re asking you to write a program that simulates Vim¡¯s replace order.<br><br>The format of Vim¡¯s replace order is ([] means optional, {} means necessary) :<br><br>    :[range]s/{pattern}/{string}/[flag]<br><br>In the order above,<br><br>¡®:¡¯ means the start of a replace order,<br><br>[range] indicates the range of the order, that is, the order works in which lines.<br><br>¡®s¡¯ is short for substitute.<br><br>{pattern} and {string} represent the string to match and replace to, respectively.<br><br>¡®/¡¯ is used to mark the beginning and ending of {pattern} and {string}.<br><br>{flag} is used to open or close some options.<br><br>{range} is often two integers separated by a comma, indicating the start line and end line¡¯s line number.<br><br>For example, ¡°4,8¡± means from line 4 to line 8 (including line 4, line 8). Line number starts from 1. You can also use a ¡®%¡¯ to represent all lines.<br><br>(Additional, Vim provides many more flexible formats. Such as, bypassing a number means the line cursor stays, ¡®$¡¯ means the last line of the text. So, ¡°,$¡± means from the line cursor stays to the last line. )<br><br>{pattern} and {string} both support regular expression (if you haven¡¯t ever heard of it, go to Google for help). If {pattern} is empty, the {pattern} of the last replace order will be used.<br><br>Obviously, ¡®/¡¯ can¡¯t be included in {pattern} and {string}. So, an additional escape character ¡®\¡¯ is used. For example, if you want to replace ¡°&lt;br&gt;¡± to ¡°&lt;br/&gt;¡±, you cannot write:<br><br>    :%s/&lt;br&gt;/&lt;br /&gt;/g<br><br>Instead, you should write:<br><br>    :%s/&lt;br&gt;/&lt;br \/&gt;/g<br><br>If there¡¯re too many ¡®/¡¯s in the expression, (for instance, &quot;file:///usr/share/man/man1/vim.1.gz&quot;), it will become troublesome. So, people think of a solution, that is, use another character as the separator (the first character after ¡®s¡¯ is always treated as the separator). For example, when using ¡®+¡¯ as the separator, the order above can be written this way:<br><br>    :%s+&lt;br&gt;+&lt;br /&gt;+g<br><br>There¡¯re many kinds of [flag]. ¡®g¡¯ means replace every time it matches. Without a ¡®g¡¯, it will only replace the first matching string. For example:<br><br>    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br><br>Execute the order bellow:<br><br>    :%s/i//g<br><br>Result is:<br><br>    #nclude &lt;stdo.h&gt;<br><br>While executing this order bellow:<br><br>    :%s/i//<br><br>Result is:<br><br>    #nclude &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br><br>Other flags including: ¡®c¡¯ indicates a confirm is required before every replacement, ¡®i¡¯ indicates case insensitive.<br><br>Here comes a problem, what if you want to replace ¡°a¡± to ¡°aa¡±? Somebody may doubt that it will go to an endless loop, but in fact, it won¡¯t. Because there is a rule that, in a replacement, the replaced characters can¡¯t be replaced again. So, if you want to replace ¡°a¡± to ¡°aa¡±, it¡¯s in fact that every successive ¡°a¡± string is doubled in length.<br><br>To simplify the problem, we make some appointments:<br><br>1.       [range] must appear, in the form of ¡°%¡± or ¡°a,b¡± (a, b are both integers, and a&lt;=b)<br><br>2.       {pattern} and {string} are both consist of characters, numbers, spaces and ¡°_¡± (not including any separator below, so an escape character is not needed)<br><br>3.       You can choose one of these characters as the separator: /~!@#$%^&amp;*()-+=<br><br>4.       [flag] is always a ¡°g¡±<br><br>A big example:<br><br>Original text:<br><br>    If the Tao is greet, then the operating system is greet.<br><br>    If the operating system is greeter, then the compiler is greet.<br><br>    If the compiler is greeter, then the applications is greet.<br><br>    The user is pleased and there is harmony in the world.<br><br>Replace order:<br><br>    :[1,4]s/greet/great/g<br><br>Or:<br><br>    :%s+greet+great+g<br><br>Either will replace the original text to:<br><br>    If the Tao is great, then the operating system is great.<br><br>    If the operating system is greater, then the compiler is great.<br><br>    If the compiler is greater, then the applications is great.<br><br>    The user is pleased and there is harmony in the world.<br><br>Please write a program to simulate this simplified vim replace order.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>The input will consist of one case.<br><br>The first line will be a positive integer L (L &lt;= 100), specifying the number of lines to be processed.
