Consider solving differential equations in several dimensions and analyzing the topology of an n-dimensional hypercube. The former is much more complicated than its one dimensional relative while the latter bears a remarkable resemblance to its ``lower-class'' cousin. <br><br>Consider an n-dimensional ``box'' given by its dimensions. In two dimensions the box (2,3) might represent a box with length 2 units and width 3 units. In three dimensions the box (4,8,9) can represent a box  4*8*9(length, width, and height). In 6 dimensions it is, perhaps, unclear what the box (4,5,6,7,8,9) represents; but we can analyze properties of the box such as the sum of its dimensions. <br><br>In this problem you will analyze a property of a group of n-dimensional boxes. You are to determine the longest nesting string of boxes, that is a sequence of boxesb1,b2,..bk  such bi,that each box  nests in box  b(i+1)( 1¡Üi&lt;k) . <br><br>A box D = ( d1,d2,...dn ) nests in a box E = ( e1,e2,...en ) if there is some rearrangement of the di, such that when rearranged each dimension is less than the corresponding dimension in box E. This loosely corresponds to turning box D to see if it will fit in box E. However, since any rearrangement suffices, box D can be contorted, not just turned (see examples below). <br><br>For example, the box D = (2,6) nests in the box E = (7,3) since D can be rearranged as (6,2) so that each dimension is less than the corresponding dimension in E. The box D = (9,5,7,3) does NOT nest in the box E = (2,10,6,8) since no rearrangement of D results in a box that satisfies the nesting property, but F = (9,5,7,1) does nest in box E since F can be rearranged as (1,9,5,7) which nests in E. <br><br>Formally, we define nesting as follows: box D = (d1,d2,....dn ) nests in box E = ( e1,e2,....en ) if there is a permutation ¦Ð of 1..n  such that ( <img src=/data/images/1614-1.gif> ) ``fits'' in ( e1,e2.....en ) i.e., if  for all  1¡Üi¡Ün. </div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>The input consists of a series of box sequences. Each box sequence begins with a line consisting of the the number of boxes k in the sequence followed by the dimensionality of the boxes, n (on the same line.) <br><br>This line is followed by k lines, one line per box with the n measurements of each box on one line separated by one or more spaces. The i(th)  line in the sequence ( 1&lt;=i&lt;=k ) gives the measurements for i(th) the  box. <br><br>There may be several box sequences in the input file. Your program should process all of them and determine, for each sequence, which of the k boxes determine the longest nesting string and the length of that nesting string (the number of boxes in the string). <br><br>In this problem the maximum dimensionality is 10 and the minimum dimensionality is 1. The maximum number of boxes in a sequence is 30. <br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>For each box sequence in the input file, output the length of the longest nesting string on one line followed on the next line by a list of the boxes that comprise this string in order. The ``smallest'' or ``innermost'' box of the nesting string should be listed first, the next box (if there is one) should be listed second, etc. <br><br>The boxes should be numbered according to the order in which they appeared in the input file (first box is box 1, etc.). <br><br>If there is more than one longest nesting string then any one of them can be output.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Input</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">5 2
