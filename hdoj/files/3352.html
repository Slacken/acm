But as usual, you were either busy reading that message, answering that e-email, or updating your wall status on facebook. ¡°Go buy some tiles¡± was all that you could remember. Your supervisor is now complaining that the tiles you bought were not squares and you¡¯ll be fired if you don¡¯t fix it!<br>¡°Fix it? How am I supposed to fix it?¡± you say to yourself. ¡°I¡¯m a programmer, The only tiles I know are those of the game Tetris!¡± There is no way you can afford to be fired either. This is your third job in less than a month. ¡°I have to fix it!¡± you keep repeating.<br>You call the store you bought the tiles from, but they won¡¯t take them back or even exchange. ¡°We cannot cancel orders once the merchandise has left the store¡±, they tell you. You take a look at the tiles, they¡¯re all rectangleshaped and all of the same size. You¡¯d be losing a lot if you cut them, not that you¡¯d be able to cut them into perfect squares in the first place. ¡°Wait a minute!¡± you say to yourself. You grab a bunch of tiles, put them in some arrangement and Voila, that¡¯s a square. But that won¡¯t convince your boss.<br>Tiles are supposed to be small, and what you came-up with is rather big. You take another look at your arrangement, and it hits you again. ¡°I¡¯m on a roll today!¡± you say proudly to yourself.You just figured out how to find the smallest number of tiles needed to form the smallest possible square.<br><img src=../../data/images/C277-1002-1.jpg><br>You rush and bring your supervisor to show him your discovery. He¡¯s not that much impressed. You¡¯re not making sense anyway (given all the blood rushing in your head trying to explain your algorithm.) You know that the calculation is definitely much simpler than what you¡¯re saying, but you just can¡¯t seem to think clearly.<br>Finally, your supervisor shouts: ¡°First of all, the tiles have to be laid-down in the same orientation. Second, I¡¯m running a construction site here, not a software shop! How do you expect the workers to figure out that number! You either write me a program to do the calculation you¡¯re describing, or you go collect your netbook, your cell, your ipod, and your blackberry, and you get out of here this minute!¡±<br><img src=../../data/images/C277-1002-2.jpg></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>Your program will be tested on one or more data sets.
