The case of a word does not affect its uniqueness.  For example, The, tHE and The are all considered equivalent.  Punctuation can appear in these documents and is handled as follows:<br>1) Periods '.' and exclamation marks '!' may appear at the end of a sentence and should not be considered a word, or part of a word.<br>2) Dashes '-' appear between hyphenated words.  The hyphenated words should be considered separately.<br>3) Commas ',' colons ':' and semicolons ';' appear within a sentence and should not be considered a word, or part of a word.<br>4) Apostrophes ' appear within contractions and possessive forms.  These symbols should be treated as if they never appeared (i.e., as if they were deleted from the word).<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>The input file contains a series of documents, each separated by an entire line of text containing only the word EOD  Each document will contain no more than 1,000 lines and at most 100 unique words.  All input lines will not contain more than 80 characters. Numbers, control characters, and punctuation symbols not listed above will not appear in the text.
