And along the lake, there are N cities, living lots of pigs. <br>In 2008, the number of pigs is growing so faster that the government decide to transfer some pigs from some cities to others. And they want to make that each city has the same number of pigs.<br>Before the transfer, the government has to build some roads between cities. For example, if we want to move some pigs from city A to city B, we have to build a road between A and B. Now the government wants to save more money for the National's Day, so they want to build roads as few as possible, i.e, they want to know how many roads at least they have to build to make that each city has the same number of pigs.<br><br><center><img src=../../../data/images/C197-1003-1.jpg></center><br><br>Giving the initial number of pigs of each city, you should tell me the least number of roads have to build.
