It is constructed with 15 sliding tiles, each with a number from 1 to 15 on it, and all packed into a 4 by 4 frame with one tile missing. Let's call the missing tile 'x'; the object of the puzzle is to arrange the tiles so that they are ordered as: <br><pre><br> 1  2  3  4<br> 5  6  7  8<br> 9 10 11 12<br>13 14 15  x<br></pre><br>where the only legal operation is to exchange 'x' with one of the tiles with which it shares an edge. As an example, the following sequence of moves solves a slightly scrambled puzzle: <br><pre><br> 1  2  3  4     1  2  3  4     1  2  3  4     1  2  3  4<br> 5  6  7  8     5  6  7  8     5  6  7  8     5  6  7  8<br> 9  x 10 12     9 10  x 12     9 10 11 12     9 10 11 12<br>13 14 11 15    13 14 11 15    13 14  x 15    13 14 15  x<br>            r-&gt;            d-&gt;            r-&gt;<br></pre><br>The letters in the previous row indicate which neighbor of the 'x' tile is swapped with the 'x' tile at each step; legal values are 'r','l','u' and 'd', for right, left, up, and down, respectively. <br><br>Not all puzzles can be solved; in 1870, a man named Sam Loyd was famous for distributing an unsolvable version of the puzzle, and <br>frustrating many people. In fact, all you have to do to make a regular puzzle into an unsolvable one is to swap two tiles (not counting the missing 'x' tile, of course). <br><br>In this problem, you will write a program for solving the less well-known 8-puzzle, composed of tiles on a three by three <br>arrangement.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>You will receive, several descriptions of configuration of the 8 puzzle. One description is just a list of the tiles in their initial positions, with the rows listed from top to bottom, and the tiles listed from left to right within a row, where the tiles are represented by numbers 1 to 8, plus 'x'. For example, this puzzle <br><br> 1  2  3 <br> x  4  6 <br> 7  5  8 <br><br>is described by this list: <br><br>1 2 3 x 4 6 7 5 8<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>You will print to standard output either the word ``unsolvable'', if the puzzle has no solution, or a string consisting entirely of the letters 'r', 'l', 'u' and 'd' that describes a series of moves that produce a solution. The string should include no spaces and start at the beginning of the line. Do not print a blank line between cases.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Input</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">2  3  4  1  5  x  7  6  8</div></pre></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Output</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">ullddrurdllurdruldr</div></pre></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Source</div> <div class=panel_content> <a href='/search.php?field=problem&key=South Central USA 1998 (Sepcial Judge Module By JGShining)&source=1&searchmode=source'> South Central USA 1998 (Sepcial Judge Module By JGShining) </a> </div> <div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Recommend</div> <div class=panel_content>JGShining</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><center style='font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#1A5CC8'><a href='statistic.php?pid=1043'>Statistic</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href='submit.php?pid=1043'>Submit</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="./discuss/problem/list.php?problemid=1043">Discuss</a> | <a href='note/note.php?pid=1043'>Note</a><br></td></tr></div></body></html>
