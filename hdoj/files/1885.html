Some of the university buildings are old as well. And the navigation in old buildings can sometimes be a little bit tricky, because of strange long corridors that fork and join at absolutely unexpected places. <br><br>The result is that some first-graders have often di?culties finding the right way to their classes. Therefore, the Student Union has developed a computer game to help the students to practice their orientation skills. The goal of the game is to find the way out of a labyrinth. Your task is to write a verification software that solves this game. <br><br>The labyrinth is a 2-dimensional grid of squares, each square is either free or filled with a wall. Some of the free squares may contain doors or keys. There are four di?erent types of keys and doors: blue, yellow, red, and green. Each key can open only doors of the same color. <br><br>You can move between adjacent free squares vertically or horizontally, diagonal movement is not allowed. You may not go across walls and you cannot leave the labyrinth area. If a square contains a door, you may go there only if you have stepped on a square with an appropriate key before. </div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>The input consists of several maps. Each map begins with a line containing two integer numbers R and C (1 ¡Ü R, C ¡Ü 100) specifying the map size. Then there are R lines each containing C characters. Each character is one of the following: <br><br><center><img src=../../../data/images/C106-1004-1.JPG></center><br><br>Note that it is allowed to have <br> <li> more than one exit, </li><br> <li> no exit at all, </li><br> <li> more doors and/or keys of the same color, and </li><br> <li> keys without corresponding doors and vice versa. </li><br><br>You may assume that the marker of your position (¡°*¡±) will appear exactly once in every map. <br><br>There is one blank line after each map. The input is terminated by two zeros in place of the map size. </div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>For each map, print one line containing the sentence ¡°Escape possible in S steps.¡±, where S is the smallest possible number of step to reach any of the exits. If no exit can be reached, output the string ¡°The poor student is trapped!¡± instead. <br><br>One step is defined as a movement between two adjacent cells. Grabbing a key or unlocking a door does not count as a step. </div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Input</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">1 10
