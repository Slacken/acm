You'll be marching your army units off to discover stuff or to fight with your neighbors.<br><center><img src=http://acm.hdu.edu.cn/data/images/C361_1005_1.jpg></center><br>The world is comprised of hexagons. Generally, units move from hexagon to hexagon, paying the &quot;Movement Cost&quot; required to enter the new hexagon.<br><i><b>Movement Points</b></i>:<br>All army units have a certain number of &quot;Movement Points&quot;(MPs) that they can expend on movement in every turn. Once they've expended those MPs, they can't move any more until the next turn.<br><i><b>Expending MPs:</b></i><br>Units expend MPs to enter tiles. The terrain of the tile determines the MP cost of the move. It doesn't cost anything to leave your current tile; the MP cost is determined by the tile you're entering.<br>A unit can always move one tile if it has any MPs left.It doesn't matter how expensive the tile is; as long as the unit has some MPs left, it can enter. <br><i><b>Terrain of the tile:</b></i><br>Open terrain like Grassland and Plains cost 1 MP to enter, while Forest and Jungle costs 2.<br><i><b>Zones of Control:</b></i><br>Enemy units exert a &quot;Zone of Control&quot;(ZOC) over the tiles around them. When a unit moves between two tiles within enemys' ZOC it expends all of MPs.(you can't move on the tile which contain an enemy)<br><i><b>Road:</b></i><br>As long as the unit moves from one tile containing a road into another tile containing a road,the unit will expend just 0.25 MPs no matter what terrain of the tile.(unless within an enemy's ZOC)<br><i><b>Rivers:</b></i><br>Rivers are between two tiles.<br>As long as the unit moves cross a rivers from a tile to another tile it expends all of MPs(unless these tiles contain roads).<br><br>Giving the information of the World, please tell me the minimum turns to cost for reaching the destination.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>The first line is a number T(1&lt;=T&lt;=30), represents the number of case.

Case 1: (0,0)->(0,1)->(1,1)
First turn cross a river, you expends all of MPs. So you need waiting second turn to reach (1,1)
Case 2: (0,0)->(0,1)->(1,1)
There are roads on these tiles, so you cross the river expends 0.25 MPs, then expends the remain MPs to reach (1,1).
Case 3: (0,0)->(0,1)->(0,2)->(1,2)->(2,2)
Even if there are roads on these tiles, but there are all in ZOC, so you will expends all of MPs each move.
