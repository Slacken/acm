When he entered the middle school, he learned Multiplication and Power Multiplication. yhr is so ambitious that he not only dreams to be a mathematician but also dreams to be richer than Bill Gates.<br>One day, he is suddenly encountered with a crazy thought that is to hunt treasure to make one of his dreams a reality. Since yhr is such a strong-willed person that he will never give up as long as his goal has not been achieved. After going through 9*9 challenges, as a reward of god for that hard, he finally discovers an antique hole which is very likely to have a good number of treasures in it. However, as every novel writes, he can never get the treasures so easily. He has to open a coded door at first. He finds that there are 2*N numbers on the door. He speculates that they must be able to generate the password. Disappointedly, there isn¡¯t any clue left for him. He has no better way but to YY. Firstly, he divides these 2*N number into N piles equally. The first pile is composed of a1,b1 and the second pile is composed of a2,b2...certainly, the i-th pile is composed of ai,bi¡­After completing this task, he calculates a1^b1*a2^b2*a3^b3¡­*an^bn and gets its result M. He takes M as the password to open the door. What¡¯s a pity, he fails. Then he starts to YY again. Maybe the right password is the minimum number x which satisfies the equation x!%M=0. So he wants to have a try. But he doesn¡¯t know how to get the number so that he has to turn to you for help. Can you help him?<br><br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>In the first line is an integer T (1&lt;=T&lt;=50) indicating the number of test cases.<br>Each test case begins with an integer n (1&lt;=n&lt;=100), then followed n lines.
