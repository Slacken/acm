Every day, it tried very hard to crawl forward, while there was a keeper who¡¯d like to maltreat this poor little snail. The snail was crawling on a one-meter rubber band at first, and it can move on k cm every minute. But after that, the keeper stretches the rubber band quickly, and it would be elongated one meter, during that the distances ratio between the snail and the two endpoints remain unchanged. In the next minute, little snail tried to keep moving forward again. <br>     ¡°Can I finally get to the endpoint?¡±<br>     The snail often asked himself such a question because he was afraid he would never succeed. Now, we hope you can tell this poor snail when he would reach the endpoint.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>Every line of the input contains an integer number k, indicating that the snail moved forward k cm every minute.
