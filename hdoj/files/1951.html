The art of vase-making at this time followed very strict artistic rules. There was a limited number of accepted styles, each defined by its shape and decoration. More specifically, there were 36 vase shapes and 36 different patterns of decoration ¨C in all 1296 different styles.<br><br>For a collector, the obvious goal is to own a sample of each of the 1296 styles. Mr Cheng however, like so many other collectors, could never afford a complete collection, and instead concentrates on some shapes and some decorations. As symmetry between shape and decoration was one of the<br>main aestheathical paradigms of the Feng dynasty, Mr Cheng wants to have a full collection of all combinations of k shapes and k decorations, for as large a k as possible. However, he has discovered that determining this k for a given collection is not always trivial. This means that his collection might actually be better than he thinks. Can you help him?</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>On the first line of the input, there is a single positive integer n, telling the number of test scenarios to follow. Each test scenario begins with a line containing a single positive integer m &lt;=100 , the number of vases in the  collection. Then follow m lines, one per vase, each with a pair of numbers, si and di, separated by a single space, where si ( 0 &lt; i &lt;= 36  ) indicates the  shape of Mr Cheng's i:th vase, and di ( 0 &lt; i &lt;=36 ) indicates its decoration.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>For each test scenario, output one line containing the maximum k, such that there are k shapes and k decorations for which Mr Cheng's collection contains all k*k combined styles.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Input</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">2
