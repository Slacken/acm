(A recent proof is believed to be correct, though it is still undergoing scrutiny.) It is possible, however, to find integers greater than 1 that satisfy the ``perfect cube'' equation a^3 = b^3 + c^3 + d^3 (e.g. a quick calculation will show that the equation 12^3 = 6^3 + 8^3 + 10^3 is indeed true). This problem requires that you write a program to find all sets of numbers {a, b, c, d} which satisfy this equation for a &lt;= 200. <br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>The output should be listed as shown below, one perfect cube per line, in non-decreasing order of a (i.e. the lines should be sorted by their a values). The values of b, c, and d should also be listed in non-decreasing order on the line itself. There do exist several values of a which can be produced from multiple distinct sets of b, c, and d triples. In these cases, the triples with the smaller b values should be listed first. <br><br>The first part of the output is shown here: <br><br>Cube = 6, Triple = (3,4,5)<br>Cube = 12, Triple = (6,8,10)<br>Cube = 18, Triple = (2,12,16)<br>Cube = 18, Triple = (9,12,15)<br>Cube = 19, Triple = (3,10,18)<br>Cube = 20, Triple = (7,14,17)<br>Cube = 24, Triple = (12,16,20)<br><br>Note: The programmer will need to be concerned with an efficient implementation. The official time limit for this problem is 2 minutes, and it is indeed possible to write a solution to this problem which executes in under 2 minutes on a 33 MHz 80386 machine. Due to the distributed nature of the contest in this region, judges have been instructed to make the official time limit at their site the greater of 2 minutes or twice the time taken by the judge's solution on the machine being used to judge this problem.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Source</div> <div class=panel_content> <a href='/search.php?field=problem&key=Mid-Central USA 1995&source=1&searchmode=source'> Mid-Central USA 1995 </a> </div> <div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Recommend</div> <div class=panel_content>Ignatius.L</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><center style='font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#1A5CC8'><a href='statistic.php?pid=1334'>Statistic</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href='submit.php?pid=1334'>Submit</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="./discuss/problem/list.php?problemid=1334">Discuss</a> | <a href='note/note.php?pid=1334'>Note</a><br></td></tr></div></body></html>
